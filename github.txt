After successfully pushing your files to GitHub, you can take a few additional steps to manage your repository and keep it up to date:

1. Verify on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository page (in this case, https://github.com/xxjpbarx/nexpoint.git) and confirm that your files are there.

2. Make Further Changes Locally
If you make additional changes to your files locally, you’ll need to follow these steps to update GitHub:

Stage Changes:
---git add .

Commit Changes:
git commit -m "Describe the changes you made"

Push Changes:
---git push

3. Pull Changes (if Collaborating)
If you’re working with others or making changes on GitHub, ensure your local repository stays up-to-date with:
---git pull

4. Create New Branches for Features or Fixes (Optional)
For future development, consider creating new branches to keep features or fixes organized:
---git checkout -b feature-branch-name

After committing to this branch, you can push it with:
---git push -u origin feature-branch-name

With these steps, you’ll be able to manage and organize updates to your GitHub project effectively.
